This repository contains version 2 of QMC=Chem.
Version 1 is available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/scemama/qmcchem).
QMC=Chem is a quantum Monte Carlo program meant to be used after
preparing a trial wave function with the
[Quantum Package](https://github.com/quantumpackage/qp2) code.

The documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://qmcchem2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Requirements
------------

* Bash
* Python3
* Fortran compiler, Intel Fortran recommended
* Lapack library, Intel MKL recommended
* [ZeroMQ high performance communication library](http://www.zeromq.org)
* [F77_ZMQ ZeroMQ Fortran interface](http://github.com/zeromq/f77_zmq/): https://github.com/zeromq/f77_zmq/releases/download/v4.3.3/f77-zmq-4.3.3.tar.gz
* [QMCkl library](https://github.com/trex-coe/qmckl): https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/releases/download/v0.3.1/qmckl-0.3.1.tar.gz
* [TREXIO library](https://github.com/trex-coe/trexio): https://github.com/TREX-CoE/trexio/releases/download/v2.2.0/trexio-2.2.0.tar.gz
* [OCaml compiler with Opam](http://github.com/ocaml)

To install the required OCaml packages, run
```bash
opam install ocamlbuild cryptokit zmq sexplib ppx_sexp_conv ppx_deriving getopt trexio
```

If you have trouble installing OCaml, on x86 systems you can download
the [this file](https://github.com/QuantumPackage/qp2-dependencies/raw/master/ocaml-bundle_x86.tar.gz)
and run
```bash
tar -zxf ocaml-bundle_x86.tar.gz
./ocaml-bundle/bootstrap.sh
./ocaml-bundle/configure.sh
./ocaml-bundle/compile.sh 
```


Installation
------------

To compile the program, run

```bash
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure && make
```

Before using QMC=Chem, environment variables need to be loaded. The
environment variables are located in the `qmcchemrc` file:

```bash
$ source qmcchemrc
```

The `QMCCHEM_NIC` environment variable should be set to the proper network interface,
usually `ib0` on HPC machines.

Tuning for the HPC system
-------------------------

The Intel compiler is preferred for better performance.
With gfortan >= 12, the option `-fallow-argument-mismatch` should be added.

Here are a few examples:
```
# Ifort
./configure FC=ifort FCFLAGS="-O2 -g -ip -ftz -finline -xCORE-AVX2 -mkl=sequential"

# GCC >= 12
./configure FCFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch -g -O2  -ffast-math  -march=native   -fno-trapping-math -fno-math-errno -ftree-vectorize -fno-stack-protector -fopenmp"
```


File preparation
----------------

To create files suitable for QMC=Chem, the `save_for_qmcchem` plugin
needs to be installed in Quandtum Package. This can be done as
```bash
qp plugins download https://gitlab.com/scemama/qp_plugins_scemama
qp plugins install qmcchem
cd $QP_ROOT/src/qmcchem
ninja
```

Then, after running a Quantum Package calculation you should run
```bash
qp run save_for_qmcchem
```
to prepare the directory for use in QMC=Chem.
