QMC=Chem: Quantum Monte Carlo for chemistry
===========================================

QMC=Chem is a quantum Monte Carlo program developed by the Toulouse (France)
group, tailored for use in quantum chemistry. It operates primarily in a
post-Full-CI context, where it leverages a quasi-Full-CI calculation from
Quantum Package. This calculation serves as a trial wave function for the
fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm, a method chosen for its relevance
in computational chemistry simulations.
