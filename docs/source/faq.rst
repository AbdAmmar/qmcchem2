Troubleshooting and FAQs
========================

This section addresses common issues and questions that users might encounter
while working with QMC=Chem, along with solutions and advice for each scenario.

1. **Installation Problems**

   **Issue**: Difficulties encountered during the installation process.

   **Solution**: Ensure that Quantum Package is installed correctly. Work within the environment provided by Quantum Package by sourcing the appropriate rc file:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ source quantum_package.rc

   This step ensures that all dependencies and environment variables required by QMC=Chem are correctly set up.

2. **Compatibility Issues on MacOS or Windows**

   **Issue**: Inability to compile QMC=Chem on MacOS or Windows.

   **Solution**: Currently, QMC=Chem only supports Linux operating systems. Users attempting to install it on MacOS or Windows may face compatibility issues. It is recommended to use a Linux environment for running QMC=Chem.

3. **Network Bottlenecks**

   **Issue**: Network communication is slow or inefficient, affecting overall performance.

   **Solution**: Verify that the correct network interface is being used by setting the ``QMCCHEM_NIC`` environment variable. On most High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, this is typically set to ``ib0``. Proper network configuration can significantly improve communication efficiency.

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ export QMCCHEM_NIC=ib0

4. **I/O Bottlenecks**

   **Issue**: Input/output operations are slowing down the computation.

   **Solution**: If I/O is a bottleneck, consider increasing the block time so that computing a block takes at least twice as long as communicating results. This adjustment can help balance computation and I/O operations, improving overall efficiency.

5. **Slow ``qmcchem result`` Command**

   **Issue**: The ``qmcchem result`` command takes a long time to execute.

   **Solution**: This issue often arises when there are too many blocks, indicating either too short a block time or the use of an excessively large number of compute nodes. To mitigate this, set the ``QMCCHEM_IO`` environment variable to ``b`` to save data in binary format, which can speed up post-processing. Note that this requires rerunning the calculation:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ export QMCCHEM_IO=b

   Remember, rerunning the calculation is necessary for the changes to take effect.
